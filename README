SECURITY NOTE
=============

The default system comes with a root `index.php` file.  This is provided for
first time users, who (of course) need quick feedback that the system is 
working, and who are likely to have placed the entire system in the document
root.

This is a highly insecure technique, provided **only** for quick-start
purposes. Web clients will be able to browse all the files in the system, not
just the public ones.

Our **very strong recommendation** is that you delete the root `index.php`
file, and instead, point your web server document root to `system/docroot/`.
Setting up a virtual host for this is generally best.


Writable Directories
====================

Be sure to make the `sqlite/` and `tmp/` directories fully-accessible to the
web server process. The easiest (but least-secure) way to do this is to allow
all users read/write/execute privileges:

{{code: bash
    chmod -R 777 sqlite
    chmod -R 777 tmp
}}

Alternatively, as a more-secure method, you may wish to `chown` or `chgrp`
those files to the web server process, and set `chmod 750` on them.


Troubleshooting
===============

* If you see "PDOException: SQLSTATE[HY000] [14] unable to open database file"
  it's probably because the `sqlite/` directory is not writable; be sure to
  issue `chmod 777 sqlite`.

* If you see session errors right away, it's probably because the
  `tmp/session/` directory is not writable; be sure to issue
  `chmod -R 777 tmp`.
